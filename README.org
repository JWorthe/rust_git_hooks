Playing with Rust as an option for writing git hooks.

To try the hooks, do the following to compile the hooks and symlink
them into your git hooks folder.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo build

ln -s $PWD/target/debug/prepare-commit-msg .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
ln -s $PWD/target/debug/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg
ln -s $PWD/target/debug/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push
#+END_SRC
